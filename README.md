# \*\* Quote Generator from Rick And Morty

Simple project learning to randomize array of Objects on the click of a button.

In this project I have learned to:

- Work with Math.floor(Math.random()) function on array based on length
- Learned to implement the function into a button onclick
- Adding multiple objects in an array
